# Tic Tac Toe

This repository houses the code developed to play Tic Tac Toe in a web browser.

This app provides the option to play both single and multiplayer.

A user can provide a name for themselves which will be referenced throughout the game.

When in singleplayer, there are two levels of difficulty:

1. Easy: The computer picks a choice at random.
2. Hard: The computer uses the minimax algorithm to pick the best choice.
